# Design-of-Smart-Device-for-Sewers-Gas-Detection-and-Alert-System
 This project develops a smart sewer gas detection system using ESP32 and MQ series sensors to monitor hazardous gas levels in septic tanks. Real-time data is displayed through the ISquare app, which alerts users of dangerous gas concentrations.
